This repository contains code and files realted to a recent experimental study evaluating how different wellhead designs (e.g., vented vs. sealed caps) affect the potential for floodwater infiltration into private wells. 

Using Hurricane Helene as a case study, we assessed how infrastructure contributes to short-term contamination risk and¬†aquifer recharge, with implications for resilient groundwater management. 
This project integrates laboratory experiments simulating floodwater inundation across common well covering types with modeled flood extents and groundwater data from monitoring wells affected by Hurricane Helene in North Carolina. We estimate contributions to post-storm changes in hydraulic head from overtopped wells, showing that well infrastructure results in non-trivial risks to the larger aquifer.

The work included is ongoing and the repository is designed to add versions of the code and share progress with collaborators. 

### üîó Raster Data (Not Included)

This repository references several large raster datasets (e.g., `.tif` flood duration maps) that exceed GitHub‚Äôs file size limits and are therefore **not included** here.

To run the code successfully:

1. **Download the raster files** from the following shared folder (you may need to request access if you are outside our group):
 üìÅ [OneDrive ‚Äì Flood Duration Maps](https://northeastern-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/jamshidi_re_northeastern_edu/EndMZRtBxAtNoGRKbBndh8AB2zKAG0mR2bKo4wSC7Flbgw?e=QlHwg2)  
   *(If you are outside our group, you may need to request access.)* 

2. **Create a folder named**: helene_flood_duration/

3. **Place all raster `.tif` files into that folder**, and ensure it is located in the root directory of this repository (i.e., the same level as your `.Rproj` file).

If you have any issues accessing the rasters or running the code, feel free to reach out.
